Social Impact: 
The implementation of accurate and up-to-date information on doctor availability through a CURA healthcare project 
significantly contributes to improved patient care. Healthcare professionals armed with reliable data can make more 
informed decisions regarding treatment options. This leads to enhanced medical services, personalized care, and better 
health outcomes for patients. By reducing uncertainty and providing real-time information, the project supports healthcare 
providers in delivering more effective and timely treatments, ultimately fostering a positive impact on the well-being of 
individuals in need of medical attention.

Business Impact: 
The CURA Health project, with its emphasis on doctor availability and streamlined interaction processes, brings about 
noteworthy business advantages. It facilitates the development of new notification systems that alert users when a booked 
slot with a doctor becomes unavailable, promoting efficient scheduling and minimizing disruptions. Furthermore, by offering 
insights into the availability of doctors for various medical issues, the project optimizes resource allocation and enhances 
overall service efficiency. This not only improves customer satisfaction but also boosts the reputation of the healthcare 
service, potentially attracting more users and contributing to the project's sustained success. The business impact is 
characterized by improved operational efficiency, increased customer engagement, and a positive competitive edge in the
healthcare sector.
