A significant problem with optimizing patient services to reduce extended wait times has surfaced in the modern 
healthcare services environment. Although the existing system provides necessary medical treatment, it suffers from 
inefficiencies that lead to long wait times for patients who want consultations. This leads to not just patient discontent 
but also causes practical issues for healthcare providers. The need to simplify and accelerate the patient journey through 
the healthcare system is crucial, since high waiting times can undermine the overall quality of care and significantly effect 
patient outcomes.

Furthermore, the lack of a reliable and current information system about doctor availability adds another level of difficulty. 
One of the biggest obstacles to successfully allocating resources and organizing patient visits is a lack of current, reliable 
information. This lack of knowledge may cause scheduling conflicts, underuse of medical professionals, and even possible 
hiccups in the smooth provision of healthcare services. Therefore, in addition to impeding operational performance, 
the current system's shortcomings in delivering accurate and timely data on doctor availability also make it more difficult 
for the healthcare institution to provide the best possible patient care experiences.

To fulfill patients' rising expectations and improve the delivery of healthcare services generally, healthcare providers must 
address these interconnected concerns. Healthcare organizations can raise patient satisfaction levels, increase operational 
efficiency, and ultimately deliver a more seamless and patient-centered healthcare experience by putting into place solutions 
that optimize patient flow and guarantee accurate information on doctor availability.
