Real-time Doctor Availability Information:
The system must provide accurate and up-to-date information about doctor availability to streamline patient appointments and optimize scheduling.
Integration with a reliable data source is required to ensure that the information presented is current and aligns with the latest medical practices and staff schedules.
Periodic updates and synchronization with the scheduling system should be automated to maintain the accuracy of the doctor availability information.

Flexibility and Adaptability:
The classification system for drugs within the project should exhibit flexibility to accommodate new drugs and adapt to changes in medical information as it evolves.
Regular updates and maintenance procedures should be in place to keep the drug classification system in sync with emerging pharmaceuticals and evolving medical practices.
The system must allow for seamless modifications to drug classifications without causing disruptions to the overall functionality, ensuring ongoing relevance and adaptability.

Compliance with Regulatory Standards:
The project must adhere to all relevant laws and regulations, particularly those set forth by the FDA, governing the classification of drugs.
Regular audits and checks should be incorporated into the system to verify compliance, and any necessary adjustments must be promptly implemented to align with changing regulatory requirements.
Documentation and reporting features should be robust to facilitate transparency and ease of regulatory compliance verification.

User-friendly Interface:
The classification system should boast a user-friendly interface that caters to the needs of both medical professionals and patients.
Navigation and interaction within the system should be intuitive, requiring minimal training for users to understand and utilize its features effectively.
Regular user feedback sessions should be conducted to identify areas of improvement in the interface, ensuring a positive and user-centric experience for all stakeholders.
